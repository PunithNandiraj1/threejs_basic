      <h2>👩🏽‍🚀 Projects</h2>

      <p>
        I have  project where the medical insurance companies are brought into a consensus
        to share the doctor's details amongst each other in order to avoid the repetition of
        validating the details of the doctor. This helps both doctor and medical insurance
        companies to save time. The app was developed using ReactJs, NodeJs, Mysql, and
        Mocha.
